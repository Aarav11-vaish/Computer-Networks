Document Signing and Verification System
Overview
This project demonstrates a basic client-server application for securely signing and verifying documents over a network using RSA encryption. The server generates an RSA key pair (public and private keys) if they don't already exist. The client sends a document to the server, which signs it and returns the signature. The client can then verify the document's integrity and authenticity using the serverâ€™s public key.

Features
RSA Key Generation: Automatically creates an RSA public-private key pair if not already present.
Document Transfer: Sends a document from client to server over TCP.
Document Signing: The server signs the document content with its private key.
Signature Verification: The client verifies the received signature using the server's public key.
Requirements
Python 3.x
rsa package for encryption and signing
socket for network communication
Install dependencies using:

bash
Copy code
pip install rsa
Files
public_key.pem: Stores the RSA public key (auto-generated if not present).
private_key.pem: Stores the RSA private key (auto-generated if not present).
document.txt: Temporary file for the document content sent by the client.
<document>.sig: Signature file generated by the server and saved by the client.
Code Components
Client Code (send_document function in client file):

Reads document content from document.txt.
Sends the content to the server over a TCP socket.
Receives the signature from the server and saves it as <document>.sig.
Verifies the signature using the public key.
Server Code (start_server function in server file):

Listens for incoming connections from the client.
Receives document content, signs it with the private key, and returns the signature to the client.
Usage
Start the Server:

Run python server.py to start the server on localhost:65432.
Run the Client:

Run python client.py.
Enter document content when prompted. The client will create a document file, send it to the server, receive a signature, and verify it.
